Description: lpNet aims at infering biological networks, in particular signaling and gene networks.
						 For that it takes perturbation data, either steady-state or time-series, 
						 as input and generates an LP model which allows the inference of signaling networks. 
						 For parameter identification either leave-one-out cross-validation or 
						 stratified n-fold cross-validation can be used.
